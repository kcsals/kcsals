- 👋 Hi, I’m Kyle Salisbury. I currently work at Plaid and love every minute of it. It truly is the best job I've ever had.
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems, as generally as I can put it. I started out as a Chemical Engineer working on vital energy solutions in the western parts 
    of the United States. I then moved over to coding as I saw the great potential and joy of problem solving in that area.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better webscrape data for indiviuals and how to better their finanical access needs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects that involve solutions for problems revolving around day to day struggles for families and individuals, such as
    finances, budgeting, home buying experiences, retirement, and a few other fun non-financial related projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... kcsals@gmail.com. I check my email daily.
